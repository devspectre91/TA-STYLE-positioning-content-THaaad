            In our urban and suburban houses what should we do wrNout cats, In
            our stting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our krtchens and
            storerooms, our farms, bams, and nckyards, in our docks, our
            granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat
            markers, and other places too numerous to mentron, how useful they
            are! In our ships, however, the rats oft . them at defiance still
            they are of great service. How wonderfully patent is the cat when
            watching for rats or mice, awaiting their egress from their place of
            refuge or Nat which is their home! How well Shakespeare in Pericles,
            Act III., descnbes this keen attention of the cat to its natural
            pursuit! The cal, IN eyrie of burning coal, Now crouches horn
            (before) the mouse, hole. A slight rustle, and the NNW, comes for, a
            quick, sharp, resolute motion, and the cat has proved Its
            usefulness. Let any one have a plague of rats and mice, as I once
            had, and let Nem be delivered therefrom by cats, as I was, and they
            will have a laerng and kind regard for then
