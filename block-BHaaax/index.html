          <h1>Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose</h1>
          <p>
            The British Government was keen on Bose taking interest in the Axis
            Powers and the developing Gandhi Bose strife. In December 1938, Bose
            had a meeting with two representatives of the German Nazi Party.
            Here, Bose told the Nazis that the Hitler regime must stop insulting
            the Indians. In India, Nazis were not liked because of their deeds
            of extinguishing the democracy, eliminating the socialist ideas. For
            the 1939 elections of the President of Congress, Subhash announced
            his candidature knowing that he would be opposed. By this time,
            Nehru was on a long holiday in Europe. When he returned in 1938,
            Gandhi suggested him to announce his name as a candidate. But he
            declined and suggested the name of Maulana Azad. But Maulana Azad
            withdrew his name and then new name came up was of Dr. Pattabhi
            Sitaramayya, an Andhra leader. But Subhash was not sure of his win.
            The result was declared on January 29, 1939 and Subhash secured 1580
            Votes. Sitaramaya got 1377 votes, thus Subhash winning by a narrow
            but clear margin.
